# ITP_Battleship
Battleship Project for ITP 2020 Summer NYU

2-player version of the game Battleship where the user can either choose to play against an AI opponent or play a 2 player game. The player(s) and/or AI will take turns guessing “shots” to destroy the opposing player’s fleet. The game will be played on a simple 8x8 grid, with 4 ships for each player. The ship locations will be generated by player input, while the locations of the AI’s ships will be generated randomly. Ships cannot overlap and may only be laid vertically or horizontally. The player will be notified of whether a player's guess “hits” a ship or not, with the player’s board or tracking grid being updated. When a ship is destroyed, the player will be notified of which ship was destroyed. The game ends when one player’s ships have all been eliminated.
